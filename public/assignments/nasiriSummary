2/22/13 - I have been working on adding the sign-up page and creating the user profile. I have ran in to an issue:
  - I am having trouble getting the password and password_confirmation to validate properly so the profile page can display.
  - Le has offered to assist me. In the meantime I will keep trying to solve it.
  
2/24/13 - The issue has been resolved. Users can now sign up and view their profile page.
  - Email, password, and password_confirmation validations all work.
  - Installed devise, an authentication gem.
  - Users can associate a gravatar with their email. I tested it with my gravatar and it works.
  - Used flash variable to display a message to user upon successfully signing up (we can add it for successfull posts too etc.).
